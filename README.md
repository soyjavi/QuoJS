QuoJS is a micro, modular, Object-Oriented and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and Ajax interactions for rapid mobile web development. It allows you to write powerful, flexible and cross-browser code with its elegant, well documented, and micro coherent API.

Designed to change the way that you write JavaScript with the goal: a 5-6k library that handles most basic drudge work with a nice API so you can concentrate on getting stuff done.

## Learn more about the project
The idea of QuoJs arose earlier this year, the author [Javi Jiménez Villar](http://twitter.com/soyjavi) saw how existing JavaScript Libraries were not optimized for mobile devices. They were very big libraries that were built based on requirements of desktop devices, so mobile performance was not optimal.
These libraries doesn't have a good support to touch events such as: touch, tap, swipe ... or a semantic API that would help the developer to create a good & cool JavaScript.
